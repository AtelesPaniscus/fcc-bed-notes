# freeCodeCamp Backend Development Programme

These are notes made while following the freeCodeCamp Backend Development programme.

---

These notes contain JavaScript examples.
The examples are also available in separate files in sub-directories of this project.

To simplify the task of writing and re-reading the notes, they were written in MarkDown syntax and then converted to HTML.

The original MarkDown and the converted HTML files are committed under the subdirectories `md` and `html` respectively.

The html files are stored in the repository as these notes are intended for use as crib-sheets while setting up and starting freeCodeCamp Backend Projects.
