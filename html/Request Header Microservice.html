<h1 id="request-header-parser-microservice">Request Header Parser Microservice</h1>
<p>This is the second of five microservice projects.</p>
<p>It is a very simple microservice that returns in JSON format part of the header of an incoming request.</p>
<p>For the fCC instructions see <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice"><code class="url">https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="set-up---my-way">Set Up - My Way</h2>
<p>No mention of using Clementine.js this time so I used the simple fCC boilerplate.</p>
<p>I created my own 'clone' of the fCC boilerplate repository the other day. Since I cannot 'fork' by own project on GitHub, it is necessary to clone it locally.</p>
<p>I cloned it as itself so that I could rearrange the hidden files. Having pushed those changes back, I renamed the local repository to <code>fcc-request-header-microservice</code>.</p>
<p>I created an empty GutHub repository of the same name and pushed the clone again.</p>
<p>This time I kept the clone since local editing of README.md and other boilerplate files is less painful than using the <code>glitch</code> editor.</p>
<p>I imported (cloned) the new GitHub repository into a <code>glitch</code> project and renamed it (after another struggle), set the description, copied the project URL to the GitHub repository meta-data and pinned the project in <code>glitch</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-application">The Application</h2>
<p>Another trivial application that should take someone who knows what they are doing only a couple of hours.</p>
<p>My solution is one file (<code>server.js</code>) that comprises 35 lines and the function that does the real work only 15 lines.</p>
<p>I added a landing page to explain what was going on. That was 27 lines of HTML. I reused the 8 lines CSS script from the last exercise. It clearly could be improved.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-end">At the End</h2>
<p>I revised READ.md and LICENCE.md.</p>
<p>I again revised <code>package.json</code> by hand but was lucky this time.</p>
<p>I used the <code>Export to GitHub</code> option in <code>glitch</code> to <code>push</code> the final project back to my GitHub repository. In GitHub I generated a pull request, merged it and then deleted the <code>glitch</code> branch.</p>
