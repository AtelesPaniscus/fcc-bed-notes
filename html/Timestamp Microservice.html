<h1 id="timestamp-microservice">Timestamp Microservice</h1>
<p>This is the first of five microservice projects.</p>
<p>It is a very simple microservice that accepts/converts/returns date stamps.</p>
<p>For the fCC instructions see <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice"><code class="url">https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="set-up---my-way">Set Up - My Way</h2>
<p>The fCC instructions tell you to set up on <code>glitch</code>. The video monologue recommends Clementine - but I can see no reason why this would be helpful.</p>
<p>I created my own 'clone' of the Clementine repository the other day. Since I cannot 'fork' by own project on GitHub, it is necessary to clone it locally.</p>
<p>I cloned it and renamed the clone to <code>fcc-timestamp-microservice</code>. I created an empty GutHub repository of the same name and pushed the clone to it.</p>
<p>I imported (cloned) the new GitHub repository into a <code>glitch</code> project and struggled to give it a name of my choice.</p>
<p>After I had successfully renamed the repository, I copied its URL to the the GitHub repository's meta-data. I also pinned the repository in <code>glitch</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-application">The Application</h2>
<p>The application is trivial - it should take no more than 3 hours but I spent a whole day on this because I am thick.</p>
<p>My solution is one file (<code>server.js</code>) that comprises 39 lines - 2 bits of framework and one routine of 16 lines. It uses the <code>strftime</code> module.</p>
<p>It was inspired by several of the Node School exercises but not the ones I expected.</p>
<p>I then noted that the example-reference project has a 'landing' page - it's own <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>So I added the second bit of framework to serve up my own 'landing' page as a 'static web site'. I confess to still being confused as to what the 'root' of this 'static web site' is.</p>
<p>I then added a simple CSS script just to prove I could do that. Adding this embellishment was more effort than the exercise itself.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-end">At the End</h2>
<p>Using Clementine installed a load of stuff I did not need that I deleted before the final commit. I should have used the simple fCC boiler plate.</p>
<p>The READ.md (and the licence file) both stated my project was Clementine so I redid them.</p>
<p>I also revised <code>package.json</code>. I did this by hand rather than use <code>npm init</code>. This was perhaps a mistake.</p>
<p>Lists in <code>package.json</code> must <strong>NOT</strong> have a final comma. This is JSON, not JavaScript (where the comma is optional). A lot of time was spent searching for an error in <code>server.js</code> that was, in fact, in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>I used the <code>Export to GitHub</code> option in <code>glitch</code> to <code>push</code> the final project back to my GitHub repository. In GitHub I generated a pull request, merged it and then deleted the <code>glitch</code> branch.</p>
